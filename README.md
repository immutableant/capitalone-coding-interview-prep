# Coding Interview Preparation

This repository contains solutions and reference materials for various coding interview problems. Each problem is documented in its own Markdown file, providing a quick reference to the problem description, solution, and implementation details.

## Problems to Solve

Below is the list of problems we are working on, with links to corresponding Markdown files. Those marked with **[TODO]** still need documentation.

1. [Count Primes](count_primes.md)  
   - Counts the number of prime numbers less than `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes for optimal efficiency.
2. [Text Justification](text_justification.md)  
   - Formats a list of words into fully justified text, distributing spaces evenly and left-justifying the last line.
3. [Rotating the Box](rotate_box.md)  
   - Simulates gravity on falling stones before rotating the box 90 degrees clockwise.
4. [Spiral Matrix](spiral_matrix.md)  
   - Extracts elements from a matrix in a spiral order by iteratively shrinking the boundaries.
5. [Meeting Scheduler](meeting_scheduler.md)  
   - Finds the earliest available time slot for a meeting using a two-pointer or heap-based approach.
6. [Two Sum Less Than K](two_sum_less_than_k.md)  
   - Finds the maximum sum of two numbers that is less than `k` using a sorted two-pointer approach.
7. [Candy Crush](candy_crush.md) **[TODO]**  
8. [Binary Tree Paths](binary_tree_paths.md) **[TODO]**  
9. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](longest_substring_no_repeats.md)  
   - A sliding window approach to find the longest substring with unique characters efficiently.  
10. [Simple Bank System](simple_bank_system.md) **[TODO]**  
11. [Block Placement Queries](block_placement_queries.md) **[TODO]**  
12. [Count Operations to Obtain Zero](count_operations_to_zero.md) **[TODO]**  
13. [Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff ≤ Limit](longest_subarray_absolute_diff.md) **[TODO]**  
14. [Simplify Path](simplify_path.md) **[TODO]**  
15. [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](best_time_buy_sell_stock.md) **[TODO]**  
16. [Minimum Operations to Write the Letter Y on a Grid](min_operations_write_y.md) **[TODO]**  
17. [Palindrome Number](palindrome_number.md) **[TODO]**  
18. [Rotate Image](rotate_image.md) **[TODO]**  
19. [Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix](longest_common_prefix.md) **[TODO]**  
20. [Add Strings](add_strings.md) **[TODO]**  
21. [Remove Boxes](remove_boxes.md) **[TODO]**  
22. [Non-overlapping Intervals](non_overlapping_intervals.md) **[TODO]**  
23. [Number of Islands](number_of_islands.md)  
    - A solution to count the number of islands in a 2D grid using DFS and BFS approaches.  
24. [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](largest_rectangle_histogram.md) **[TODO]**  
25. [Design File System](design_file_system.md) **[TODO]**  
26. [Meeting Rooms II](meeting_rooms_ii.md)  
    - A method to determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required, using a Min-Heap and sorting.
